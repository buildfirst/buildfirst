# Bundle Task

This example shows how to configure the `concat` Grunt task, as discussed in chapter 2 of the book.

In the example, we'll be bundling together all of the `*.js` files in `public/js`, and placing them in a bundled file at `build/js/bundle.js`.

To run this example, write the following command in your terminal.

```shell
grunt concat:js
```
