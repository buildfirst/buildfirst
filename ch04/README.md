# Release, Deployment, and Monitoring

##### _(Part I, Chapter 4)_

In this chapter we cover **release-grade environments**, such as `staging`, and `production`. We also go over deployment, application monitoring, logging, and continuous integration practices. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
